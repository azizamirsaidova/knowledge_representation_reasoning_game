# Murder Mystery Mansion Game

The repo includes files for “Murder Mystery Mansion” game is inspired by the board game Clue/Cluedo, a classical mystery game. The game was built and presented using P.D.D.L. (Planning Domain Definition Language) scripts.

## Task

The primary objective of the game was to identify who murdered the game's victim, what was the murderer’s motivation for killing, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used in the crime scene. Similar to the board game, the game we built has various characters, tools (weapons), and rooms within the mansion.

## Method

* The *initial starting point* of the game is the crime scene where the heiress of the mansion has been murdered.
* The *goal state* of the game is for the detective to find out who the actual murderer is and what was his/her motivation behind commiting the murder.
* The *detective* is the game player (the querier) trying to solve the murder case by visiting the crime scene, identifying clues, and interrogating the characters of the game.
